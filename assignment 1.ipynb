    "ABOUT DATA SET\n",
    "The Open Data Program makes the data generated by the City of Seattle has been openly available to the public for the purpose of increasing the quality of life for the residents, increasing transparency, accountability and comparability, promoting economic development and research, and improving internal performance management.\n",

    "\n",
    "ABOUT THIS PROJECT\n",
    "The objective is to exploit this data to extract vital features that would enable us to end up with a good model that would enable the prediction of the severity of future accidents that take place in the state. This would further enable the Department of Transportation to prioritise their SOPs and channel their energy to ensure that fewer fatalities result in automobile collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "IN SIMPLE WORDS: from previous the data where we have a records of all accidents and severity caused in seattle city we will try to predict the severity of an accident that may happen in future so as to reduce those .\n"
